        <p>Your backlog is getting out of hand. You've got the budget to add developers but finding good ones takes forever. You know you should do a better job of networking, advertising positions and reaching out to candidates. You and your team are pulled in 100 directions and nobody has time to properly screen candidates. The interview process could be so much better, you read a blog post a few months back where someone bragged about their fancy way of doing tech interviews. This weekend you'll block out some time to read that and maybe put it in place. You're thinking it might make sense to hire a full-time tech recruiter but who will do all the tech interviews?</p>

<p>Fuck. That. Shit.</p>

<p>Stop. Please, just stop. No more recruiters. No more job postings. No resumes. No programming interviews. No Skype calls with candidates. Stop trying to hire. </p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>The whole reason you're hiring is to make your team faster. You imagine this glorious future in which you've hired the perfect team and they are all focused on building new features. So to get there you distract your existing team with a never ending death-march to recruit and screen candidates. Everyone would rather be coding. It's terrible for morale. But so would hiring someone who sucks, right? </p>

<p>Instead of wasting your team's time with this bullshit help them get shit done. Connect them with the best developers on the planet. The ones who are contributing to the libraries you depend on. These developers will make your team faster. And happier. Every minute spent pairing with experts makes your team stronger. Experts will save you more in 1 hour  insights than an average dev does in a week.</p>

<a id="who" class="anchor" href="#who" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who</h2>

<p>Remember this. The people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on. We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and taxi drivers and we know everything about you. We process your insurance claims and credit card charges. We control every part of your life.</p>

<p>Tech recruiting and hiring burn crazy amount of time. It's a massive distraction. None of that time and energy moves the business forward and nobody likes doing it. What if you could get a better outcome with less money and zero effort?</p>

<p>The future of work is small leveraged teams of 100x performers. Start by hiring only 10x people. Keep them 10x by staying small, large teams drag everyone down to speed of worst performers.  Get to 100x by giving 10x employees frictionless priority access to the ideal 10x experts for whatever they're working on. </p>

<a id="reward-open-source-committers" class="anchor" href="#reward-open-source-committers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reward open source committers</h3>

<p>by delivering them opportunity. Want a job? Don't waste your time with resumes and recruiters. Pick an open-source project you love and start helping. Commit often, opportunity will come.</p>

<p>You just raised a big VC round and need to spend that cash quick. All the best companies have big teams. Then you can have lots of meetings and corporate events. Sounds awesome, good luck. Probably you should post a job on LinkedIn or hire a recruiter.</p>
