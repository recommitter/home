{"name":"Re: Committer","tagline":"Instead of slowing you down, what if hiring sped you up?","body":"\r\nYour backlog is getting out of hand. You've got the budget to add developers but finding good ones takes forever. You know you should do a better job of networking, advertising positions and reaching out to candidates. You and your team are pulled in 100 directions and nobody has time to properly screen candidates. The interview process could be so much better, you read a blog post a few months back where someone bragged about their fancy way of doing tech interviews. This weekend you'll block out some time to read that and maybe put it in place. You're thinking it might make sense to hire a full-time tech recruiter but who will do all the tech interviews?\r\n\r\nFuck. That. Shit.\r\n\r\n# Re: Committer\r\nStop. Please, just stop. No more recruiters. No more job postings. No resumes. No programming interviews. No Skype calls with candidates. Stop trying to hire. \r\n\r\n## The only way to win is not to play\r\nTech recruiting and hiring burn crazy amount of time. It's a massive distraction. None of that time and energy moves the business forward and nobody likes doing it. What if you could get a better outcome with less money and zero effort?\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nThe whole reason you're hiring is to make your team faster. You imagine this glorious future in which you've hired the perfect team and they are all focused on building new features. So to get there you distract your existing team with a never ending death-march to recruit and screen candidates. Everyone would rather be coding. It's terrible for morale. But so would hiring someone who sucks, right? \r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\n### Connect\r\nInstead of wasting your team's time with this bullshit help them get shit done. Connect your team's github project to ReCommitter and we'll introduce you to the best developers on the planet. The ones who are contributing to the libraries you depend on. Who are too busy coding to look for a new job.\r\n\r\n### Pair\r\nEvery week ReCommitter will send you a curated list of developers. You pick the ones you'd like to pair with. Re:Committer makes it happen. These developers will make your team faster. And happier. Every minute spent pairing with experts makes your team stronger. Experts will save you more in 1 hour insights than an average dev does in a week.\r\n\r\n### Hire\r\nSome experts will be better than others. Once in a while an expert will be really interested in your company or get inspired by the problem you're solving. Use Re:Committer to pair with them a few times, see where it leads. When you're ready Re:Committer can help you pop the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### I'm looking for work. Can you help?\r\n\r\nWant a job? Don't waste your time with resumes and recruiters. Pick an open-source project you love and start helping. Commit often, opportunity will come.\r\n\r\n### OK I'm sold. How can I sign up?\r\n\r\nRecommitter is an invite-only experiment. Every week we're picking a couple new companies to work with. Platform membership costs $1000/month and is only available for teams based in NYC. Want in? Ping us at [hello@recommitter.com](mailto:hello@recommitter.com)\r\n\r\n### Why not just hire a lot of people then fire the ones that suck?\r\nThe future of work is small leveraged teams of 100x performers. Start by hiring only 10x people. Keep them 10x by staying small, large teams drag everyone down to speed of worst performers.  Get to 100x by giving 10x employees frictionless priority access to the ideal 10x experts for whatever they're working on. \r\n\r\n### I just need to hire a bunch of developers fast. Can you help?\r\nYou've raised a big VC round and need to spend that cash quick. All the best companies have big teams. Then you can have lots of meetings and corporate events. Sounds awesome, good luck. Probably you should post a job on LinkedIn or hire a recruiter.\r\n\r\n### How can I find out more?\r\nEmail us here: [hello@recommitter.com](mailto:hello@recommitter.com) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
